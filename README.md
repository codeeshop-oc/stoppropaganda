Russia has invaded Ukraine and starts a war. Russian media denies any of its attacks on civilian as well as denies any Russian troops casualties. According to them, they are doing this "special operation" to protect Ukrainians.

Mykhailo Federov (Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine) has shared this [tweet](https://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1497642156076511233) post encouraging cyberattack on certain targets via Telegram group. This will be primary source of the target websites for this application.

Anyone who knows someone from Russia should send them a personal message with a link to Zelenskyy's speech to the Russian people. It is important that as many as possible in Russia hear his words. Write to all Russians you know!  #Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º https://youtu.be/Fwzb_JX7u04
